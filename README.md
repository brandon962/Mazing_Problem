Mazing Problem

Design a maze (15 X 15) 
    Random generate 0 and 1, 0: through path1: blocked path 
    Random generate the entrance and exit 
    Entrance and exit denote to 2

Find the path to exit (60%) Print the maze like P3、P4、P5

Show the path to specify 0 then go to exit like P7、P6 (20%)

Show the shortest hop count with array graph (30%)
    Weight of direction : N、E、S、W count 1 hop 
    Weight of direction : NW 、SW 、SE 、NE count 3 hop
